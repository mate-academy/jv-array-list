# jv-array-list

Create your own `ArrayList` class which implements the `List` interface. Override the methods required.
 
Make your `ArrayList` behave the same way as `java.util.ArrayList` (it should have the default capacity, the internal array should grow 1.5 times when it is full, etc.).

Throw custom `ArrayListIndexOutOfBoundsException` in case the index passed to any of the methods is invalid.
Throw `NoSuchElementException` in `remove(T element)` if there is no such element present.
